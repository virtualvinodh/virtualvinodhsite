    <p class="text-body2">Ganapati, or Ganesha as he is popularly known is a pan Indic deity who is revered in both Hinduism & Buddhism as far as Japan. As in the Brahmanic religion, Buddhism too recognizes Ganapati or Vinayaka as the remover of obstacles. The bijakshara (seed syllable) of Ganapati is “gaḥ“. According to Buddhist legends, he was subdued by Avalokiteshvara. In one Legend, Avalokiteshvara assumes the eleven-headed form and subdues Vinayaka who is causing destruction. He  performs the act by cutting of the head of Vinayaka and placing the head on him, thus taking over Vinayaka's form. In the other Legend, Avalokiteshvara takes the form of a woman to seduce Vinayaka and prevents him from creating obstacles. But, ultimately, both Avalokiteshvara & Ganapati are seen as the manifestation of Buddha Maha Vairochana. Hanguag, a disciple of Amoghavajra, explains that the bijas of Avalokitesvara, "hrīh", & Ganapati, "gaḥ", are an expression of provisional reality.</p>
    <p>There are two sutras on Ganapati that contain dharanis to the deity. The Dharani Sutra of the Golden Ganapati, found in the Chinese Taisho Tripitaka T. XXI 1269, was delivered by the Buddha to his disciple Shariputra when the Buddha was residing at Shravasti. The dharani recorded is very much corrupted. However, another sutra titled "Arya Maha Ganapati Hridaya", contains a complete dharani. At the end of this sutra, Ganapati himself appears and assures that he will protect and bestow wishes of those who uphold this dharani.</p>
    <p> The text of the Arya Maha Ganapati Hridaya is given below:</p>
    <p class="text-h6">Ārya Mahā Gaṇapati Hṛdaya Dhāraṇi Sutra</p>
    <p>namo bhagavate āryamahāgaṇapatihṛdayāya |</p>
    <p>namo ratnatrayāya ||</p>
    <p>Thus I have heard. Upon a time, the Blessed One was staying at Rajagriha, on the Vulture Peak, together with a great assembly of monks: forty-five hundreds of monks and numerous great Bodhisattvas. On that occasion the Blessed One told the Venerable Ananda:</p>
    <p>“Ananda, whoever, son or daughter of high birth, would keep [in mind], recite, obtain and propagate these “heart” [spells] of Ganapati, his will be the accomplishments of all his tasks”</p>

    <p>“These Ananda, are the “hearts” of Ganapati”</p>
    <p>“Any son or daughter of high birth, whether monk or nun, lay brother or sister who undertakes any matter [such as] accomplishing the [rites to call a sacred being by means of] spells, worshipping the three ewels, travelling to another country, going to the royal court or concealing [from view] should upon worshipping the blessed Buddha, practice seven times the Arya Ganapati Hrdaya [spells]: for him all tasks will be accomplished; no doubt about this!. He should forever put an end to all strifes and quarrels , violence and envy, and become entirely calm. Day upon day abiding the rules and practicing a full seven times: it will come out into the fortune of this great one! Upon his coming to the royal court there will be great kindness (prasada). He will become a keeper of hearing. There wil be no major illness to his body. Never will he assume the descent as a tara-praksina or the descent as a humble bee: nothing ellse will occur to him that the mind of awakening. In every birth he will be remembering [his previous] births.”</p>
    <p>Thus spoke the Blessed One, and upon receiving [his teaching] these monks, these great bodhisattvas and whole attendance, the world with the gods, the humans, the asuras, the garudas and the gandarvas rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One.</p>
    <p>(Translation adapted from Duquenne)</p>
    <p class="text-h6">Tibetan Variant</p>
    <p>There is a Tibetan version of the sutra with a variant form of the above dharani. In Tibetan, the sutra is known as ‘Phags pa Tshogs kyi dDag po’I sNiying po'. The text of the mantra differs from that of the above Nepalese version slightly as shown below:</p>

    <p class="text-h6">The Deity Gaṇapati Hṛdayā</p>
    <p>Interestingly, a female deity named “Gaṇapati Hṛdayā” exists. She is supposedly the prajna-shakti consort of Ganapati. Her form in a text called “Dharmakosha Sangraha” is described as:</p>
    <p class="blockquote">gaṇapatihṛdayā ekamukhā dvibhujā varadā abhayā nṛtyāsanā</p>
    <p class="blockquote">Ganapatihridayaa is one-faced, two-armed, exhibits in her two hands the Varada & Abhaya poses, and shows the dancing attitude
