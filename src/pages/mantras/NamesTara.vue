    <p class="text-body2">Tara is a female bodhisattva belong to the Mahayana pantheon. The name roughlly translate as "one who ferries across [samsara]". It is said that Tara purposely chose to remain in the female form to prove that the female body is not in any way inferior to the male body. According to Buddhist legends, she has emanted herself in various ways in the previous aeons. In the present aeon, she is emanted from Avalokiteshvara's tears. Tara's worship is currenlty very popular in Tibet and Nepal. In the past, it had also been very popular in Indian Mahayana. She is usually invoked to overcome fear and in times of danger. There exits 21 emanations of Tara, the most popular ones being Green Tara and White Tara. Tara was eventually absorbed by the Hindu tantra from the Buddhist tantra. A very late Hindu tantra, titled Brihannila tantra, dated to the 17th Century explains the visualization of Goddess Tāriṇī as follows.
</p>
  <p class="blockquote">[…] one visualizes the letter “āḥ” in a red lotus. Again, above that one visualizes the letter “tāṁ” on a white lotus situated above that. Above that, again one visualizes the letter “hūṁ” with a blue color. […]  the top of her head is adorned with [the Buddha] Aksobhya […]</p>
  <p>This text is in the form of a conversation between Shiva [in the form of Bhairava] and his consort Shakti. The Buddhist connection is not too hard to find out from the above description. It is possible that the shrines dedicated to Tara were converted after Buddhism's decline in India. </p><p>In fact, the famous Meenakshi Temple, at Madurai, South India is said to have been a Tara temple in the past. Interestingly, the Goddess Meenakshi has a Green Hue, which suggests that she could have been Green Tara. Buddhist figures have been found inside the temple. Also temples dedicated to the so-called "Draupadiyamman" in Tamil Nadu, Southern India is also speculated to have been Tara temples in the remote past with the folk deity herself being originally bodhisattva Tara.</p>
<p class="text-h6">Tārāṣṭottara-śata-nāma-stotram</p>
<p>Within in the Indian mileu, it it quite common to praise deiteis with a litany of epithets. The number usually varies according to the composition but the usual counts are 108 or 1000. The former being called "Ashottarra-shata-nama" (eight-above-hundered-names) and the lattter "sahasra-nama" (hundred-names). . Many of the epithets are usually generic and could be applied to any deity regardless of their affiliation. But they also list some very specific epithets of the deity as well. This stotra is such a work dedicated to Tara listing her 108 epithets. </p>
<p>The stotra is set at Mount Potalaka, the abode of  Avalokiteshvara. It is described as being filled with various kinds of flowers, jewels, animals and the sweet songs of the kinnaras. Various siddhas, vidyadharas, gandharvas, sages, bodhisattvas and the lords of the ten bodhisattva-bhumis throng the place. Various wrathful deities along with Hayagriva also surround the place. Avalokiteshvara is teaching to that assembly. Thereupon, bodhisattva Vajrapani out of compassion asks Avalokiteshvara the ways by which the sentient beings bound by various fears can free themselves from Samsara. Avalokiteshvara replies that by the power of the vow and his will, the mother of the world (Tara) was born to save the sentient beings. She illuminates the entire world and terrifies the demons by causing the three worlds to shake.</p>
<p class="blockquote">nīlotpalakarāṃ devīṃ mā bhairmā bhairiti bruvan <br/>
jagatsaṃrakṣaṇārthayāhamutpāditā jinaiḥ|<br/>
kāntāre śastrasaṃpāte nānābhayasamākule||<br/>
smaraṇādeva nāmāni sattvān rakṣāmyahaṃ sadā|<br/>
tārayiṣyāmyahaṃ sattvān nānābhayamahārṇavāt|| <br/>
tena tāreti māṃ loke gāyanti munipuṃgavāḥ| <br/>
kṛtāñjalipuṭo bhūtvā tataḥ sādarasādhvasaḥ||</p>
<p class="blockquote">The deity holding the blue lotus proclaims, “Do not fear! Do not fear!
  <br/> For the protection of the world, I was produced by the Jinas (Conquerers)<br/>
   In the woods, during battles, when filled with various fears <br/>
    When only [my] names are remembered, I protect the sentient beings always  <br/>
     I will ferry the sentient beings out of the ocean of various fears <br/>
     Therefore, the Sages sing me in the world as Tara (one who ferries across) <br/>
      After holding their hands together, showing respect."</p>
<p>Vajrapani then requests Avalokiteshvara to proclaim the 108 names of Tara, which grants various benefits.  Then, then lord of the world (Jagannātha) Avalokiteshvara, with a smile and a mudra in his right hand, appreciates Vajrapani and declares the names that can help one to reach Sukhavati (Amitabha's abode). The following are the 108 names of Tara. She is seen equated to the perfect of wisdom (prajñāpāramitā). She is even referred as the “mother of the Vedas" (Vedamata). Another interesting name is śrīmallokeśvarātmajā (śrīmat-lokeśvara-ātmajā), the auspicious one who is born from Lokeshvara. But many of the names can very well be applied to any female deity.</p>
