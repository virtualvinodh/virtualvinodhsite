    <p class="text-h5">Grantha</p>
    <p class="text-body2">Grantha is an important historical script that was once used to write Sanskrit throughout South East Asia and greater Tamil Nadu. It was popular in Tamil Nadu until the early 20th century. After a gradual decline, Devanagari superseded it as the common script for Sanskrit. But Grantha still lingers around as a minority script and can be found in Panchangas, Yantras and Vedic schools around Tamil Nadu. The epigraphic variety of the Grantha script can be found as wall inscriptions in many temples.</p>

    <p class="text-h6">Grantha Script Lessons</p>
<p>The script is an abugida with complex conjunct formations which makes it difficult to learn. I have attempted to provide an easy-to-read primer for anyone wishing to learn this historical script. The version presented here is the late modern variety of the Grantha script.</p>

<p> It was written around 2009, when I just came out of my teens. The writing style pretty much reflects that. At some point, I will probably rewrite it at some point to make it sound a bit less juvenile :)</p>
